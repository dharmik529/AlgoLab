## Minimum Spanning Tree

**Exercise1:** 10 Points

Write the Kruskal’s algorithm and briefly explain the algorithm. Perform algorithm analysis to find the time complexity. Implement the Kruskal’s algorithm and test with minimum 2 graph examples. Use 1 example for a dense graph and 1 example for a sparse graph.

**Exercise2** 10 Points

Write the Prim’s algorithm and briefly explain the algorithm. Perform algorithm analysis to find the time complexity. Implement the Prim’s algorithm and test with minimum 2 graph examples (use the same examples as in exercise-1).

**Exercise3** 10 Points

Discuss minimum 3 differences between Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithm. Briefly explain any 2 practical applications.

Deliverables: Report, codes and the demonstration video (~3 minutes)
For video demonstration, answer the following questions:
1. Using your codes, Explain the working of Kruskal’s algorithm?
2. Using your codes, Explain the working of Prim’s algorithm?
