## Red Black or AVL Tree

**Exercise:**
Develop python codes to create a Red Black or AVL Tree. This tree should perform the following:
- Traverse nodes i.e. print all nodes
- Insert nodes
- Delete nodes

Note: every time you add a node or delete node, the tree shouldnâ€™t violate the Red Black or AVL tree properties. create a tree with minimum 10 values and demonstrate all the functions.Attach the screenshots of the results. 

Deliverables: Report, codes and the demonstration video (~3 minutes) 
For video demonstration, answer the following questions:
    1. For the chosen self-balancing tree, explain how self-balancing tree works for keeping the tree balanced? Explain the algorithm?
